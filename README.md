# hexagonal-spiral

  You may know little about prime spiral or Ulam spiral ##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral##, then I think if I change the square lattice to hexagonal lattice and what its looks like.
  you can start this project by click "superprime", by the way, this stuff is so poor which finished in a winter vacation of my Sophomore year, please don't mind.
  what's more, wiki has already has its picture as fllowing

# Files introduce
========================

comdef.h
	this is a file which included lots of common definetion about hole project such as the mumber of point, coordinates of hexagonal
center. you can look diferent output by changing the defination.

Xfunc.cpp and Yfunc.cpp
	These are  files of X and Yfunction. For each point num of i in n, it has a X coordinate and a Y coordinate,input i, you will get X and Y
